1) Problem statement:

Communities across the United States are facing the dangers of climate change and air pollution. To address the issue, we are surveying air pollution and renewable energy datasets to create predictive models that can be utilized by policymakers, economists, and civil society organizations. The goal of this research is to better aid our understanding on how air pollution is affecting our society as a whole. The model will be capable of predicting air pollution levels as a function of changes in renewable energy  and fossil fuel productions.
